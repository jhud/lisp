# Python LISP interpreter based on the original 1960 John McCarthy paper
"Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine, Part I"
https://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.pdf

This LISP variant is not designed to be particularly useful, correct, elegant, or readable; 
it is a minimal implementation of S-expression LISP from the original paper, and should be read
in conjunction with that.

## Why write this? 
There is quite a jump from the original paper to all later practical LISP implementations.
I couldn't find any minimal code examples of theoretical LISP from the original paper, so I wrote it in order
to better appreciate how theoretical LISP became a practical programming language.
